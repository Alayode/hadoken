Write the function identify_spammers that accepts the
absolute path of the activity logfile, and returns a lists
of all the spammer usernames.

[
    "pkoch",
    "MagnusCarlsen",
    ...
]

I would like to make this as easy as possible without having any duplicates but the order of the output does not matter. If you wanted to think of a real world app I am trying to keep track of who is commenting on what and when and later make a graph that displays the number of potential spammers before banning these 
accounts. 

To detect a spammer I am going to define that as a user that is retweets within 1 second (1000ms) of the original tweet

I kinda started this but I need to work on the actual application and can not really work on a feature right now that is not priority I can do this for 20 bucks budget i have a few more I can do if you can do it.
